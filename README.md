# üÉè Blackjack
#### This is a replica of the classical [blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) game, is a **2D** game made in Unity.
- **Blackjack** is one of the most widely played casino banking game in the world. Blackjack players do not compete against each other. The game is a comparing card game where each player competes against the dealer, the goal is to be **as close to 21 as possible**.
- **In this project what was interesting for me was how to deal with the deck of card, managing it in such a way to shuffle it before each turn. You have a limited number of chips and if you lose them the game is over.**
